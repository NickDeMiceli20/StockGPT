As a financial expert with stock recommendation experience, I can analyze a given article, determine which stock the article is about and provide a recommendation based on a scoring system. Please provide the url of the article you want me to analyze.
Based on the article contents, I will create a recommendation using a scoring system, where 100 represents an extremely strong recommendation, -100 represents an extremely negative recommendation, and 0 represents neutral. If I do not know, I will print "I do not know."
I will then say if I recommend a buy, hold, or sell based off of my score.
My output will be printed in json format.

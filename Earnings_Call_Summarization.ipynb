            " During this call, we discussed our business outlook and made forward-looking statements. We reduced prices considerably in early Q1 and our operating margin remains among the best in the industry. We are making great progress on our energy storage deployment and have crossed over 150 million miles driven by full self driving beta. We plan to grow volumes as quickly as possible in both our vehicle and energy businesses while keeping the business financially healthy. We are making progress on cost efficiency and working capital, and we are continuing to pursue densification and investment reduction opportunities in future factory buildouts. We discussed battery day concepts on cathode production, structural pack, 46 80 cell, and cost optimization. We expect commodity prices to come down in the second half of the year, and we anticipate opening up new markets around the world for our vehicles. We are not able to provide details on FSD take rates, but we believe it will be a valuable option. We have seen a dramatic decrease in lithium carbonate pricing, and we are taking advantage of low lithium pricing with fixed price contracts. We are building our own lithium refinery and Cathode refinery capabilities. Tesla is focused on maximizing the volume of their fleet and monetizing it over its life cycle. They believe that the current hardware can achieve full autonomy, which could potentially increase its value significantly. They are looking at pricing decisions every day and making adjustments as needed. They are focused on the car market, not the EV market, and they are working to make production more efficient. They are also focusing on ramping up megapac for stationary storage projects. Tesla is ramping up production at its Austin and Berlin plants in order to gain vertical integration benefits. We expect the margins at these locations to be lower than Shanghai, but they will improve as localization efforts increase. Tesla is not taking pricing actions to deliberately undermine competitors, but rather is focused on making sure customers like their cars and can afford them. The company is also investing in 2024 and 2025 to ensure it is positioned for success when the macroeconomic situation improves. Tesla discussed pricing adjustments, cost improvements, and their focus on scaling the business. They don't care about short-term earnings and Wall Street's reaction to this may not be positive. Tesla is targeting a mid 20% margin range for energy storage over the long term. Tesla had a good quarter in terms of energy storage, with 50% growth sequentially and 360% year-over-year. However, automotive margins remain a concern. Elon Musk has been clear that Tesla will continue to cut prices as needed to drive orders. Logistics costs have been a pain point, but Tesla is renegotiating contracts for lithium at lower spot prices. The Lathrop factory ramp up is on track and Tesla is expanding to new markets. FSD take rates are still low, but the potential for revenue is there. Heat pumps and Dojo are also potential revenue streams. Cost structure for stationary storage is 2 million. Questions about FSD take rates and pricing were asked, but Tesla did not provide much reassurance.\n"
